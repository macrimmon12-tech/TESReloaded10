// Temporal anti-aliasing: temporal accumulation with camera reprojection, plus sub-pixel jitter of
// the world render so a still image gets anti-aliased too. Ported from Oblivion Reloaded E3's TAA;
// see TAA.fx.hlsl for what changed and why, and BeginJitter below for how the jitter is applied.
//
// Two passes per frame, both full resolution, over a pair of FP16 history buffers used in turn:
//   Resolve: current frame + reprojected last frame (one buffer) -> this frame (the other buffer)
//   Output:  this frame's buffer -> the frame
// The buffers then swap roles, so this frame's resolve is next frame's history with no copy. Resolve
// cannot write the history it is reading, hence two of them. The history is FP16
// rather than the frame's 8 bits because at a 0.9 blend weight each frame moves the history only
// 10% of the way to the current value, and in 8 bits any difference under about 5/255 rounds
// straight back to the old value -- a ghost that stops fading and never clears.
